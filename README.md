## ML Algorithms from Scratch
This project features my custom-built implementations of common data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms.
I did so to gain a deep understanding of the math and code behind them. ***This project is a work in progress***!
I am working to add new models, training options, and features.
### Preprocessing
### Models
##### Linear Regression
Current model implementation supports multiple types of training: 
singular value decomposition (default), normal equation, gradient descents
(batch, mini-batch, and stochastic).
### Model Analysis
