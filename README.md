## ML Algorithms from Scratch
This project features my custom-built implementations of common data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms.
I did so to gain a deep understanding of the math and code behind them.
### Preprocessing
### Models
##### Linear Regression
Current model implementation supports three types of training: 
singular value decomposition (default), gradient descent, and the normal equation.
### Analysis
